## What This Is

Your mind isn't separate from your body. What you do in the gym shapes how you think. Movement is the is the most reliable way to change your mental state, allowing the practitioner over come negative mental states, and live a better, more fulfiled life.

This wasn't always controversial. Ancient Greek philosophy schools trained the body alongside the mind - Plato wrestled, the Stoics practiced physical endurance. In the East, martial arts and meditative traditions never split the two apart. Yoga, tai chi, kung fu - these were always integrated practices.

Somewhere along the way, we severed the connection. Philosophy became academic. Fitness became vanity. Both got weaker for it.

Askesis is my attempt to close that gap - to treat physical training and philosophical work as the same practice. This site documents what I'm learning.

The work centers on three things:

**Training** — Strength, conditioning, movement. Not for aesthetics or performance metrics, but as a way of inhabiting your life with more clarity and capability.

**Philosophy** — Not academic abstraction. Practical inquiry into how you think, perceive, and respond. Philosophy as something you do, not something you read about.

**Awareness** — Paying attention to what's actually happening. Not as escape or optimization, but as a way of meeting your life directly.

## Who I Am

I'm Robert Grunau, and I've always lived at the edge of this integration - never fully in both at once. I've had periods where I was physically strong but mentally scattered. Seasons where I was mentally sharp but physically weak. Now, at this phase of my life, I want both.

I'm documenting this practice because writing has always been how I process what's happening in my life. It's the most direct way to sort out your thinking and achieve clarity. The Askesis project is that documentation - a record of attempting to close the gap.

Askesis means training, discipline, practice. It's what the ancient Greeks called the physical and mental conditioning that made you capable of living well. That's what I'm after.
